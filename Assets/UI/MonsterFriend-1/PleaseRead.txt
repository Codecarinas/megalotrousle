Monster Friend is an Undertale logo font. By no means do I, theFIZZYnator/JapanYoshi, warrant total accuracy of this clone.

Intended use: Layer the two fonts together. They were designed and intended to be used together. Back goes to the background and Fore goes to the foreground. Simple as that!

License: You may use this font non-commercially, or in commercial works about Undertale. It's safe not to use it in public, though, because Toby is going to get pissed.

Now back to running away from Toby Fox's wrath.
